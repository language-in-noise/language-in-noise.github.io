Dr. Walshâ€™s research focuses on speech production in typically developing speakers and in speakers diagnosed with speech disorders across the lifespan. Recent work uses a multilevel approach combining neurophysiological (e.g., fNIRS), physiological, and behavioral approaches to assess how stuttering develops in young children, and to answer questions about the variability in the outcomes: why many young children recover from early stuttering while others persist and develop a lifelong chronic condition. REU student will work with lab team members to collect data from young children and their families and learn different techniques to analyze physiological and behavioral data. Mentored undergraduate students in past three years: 2-3 per year.
