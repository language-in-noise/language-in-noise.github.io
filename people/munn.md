Dr. Munnâ€™s research is on syntax and first language acquisition and their relation to semantics. Research topics in syntax include the syntax and semantics of conjunction and disjunction, cross-linguistic variation in the syntax of noun phrases, and intra-speaker variation in syntax and semantics of the perfect tense. Research topics in first language acquisition include the acquisition of the semantics of definiteness and scalar implicatures relating to definite determiners, comparatives and disjunction. Variability in syntax both across dialects and within a speaker is one kind of 'noise' that both adult speaker and language learners encounter. Such variability can lead to language change. It is unknown whether this kind of 'noise' is beneficial or detrimental to adult and child language processing and child acquisition. REU students will investigate the nature of syntactic and semantic variability in both adults and children focusing especially on the perfect tense, and using online experimental methods as well as corpus studies. Munn has mentored approximately 50 undergraduates in research projects over the past 10 years. 1 publication with undergraduates; 7 conference presentations with undergraduates.
