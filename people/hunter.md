Dr, Hunter’s research is on voice use and vocal health of occupational voice users like teachers; particularly, he has examined how voice use, and thereby vocal health, is impacted by noise and other environmental characteristics, as well as physiological and behavioral factors. Hunter’s other research interests include room acoustics, speech signal processing, biomechanics and biomechanical modeling of speech production. Specifically related to the current project exploring the impact of noise on verbal communication, Hunter has used a range of acoustic environments (anechoic and reverberation chambers, virtual reality environments, variable acoustic and sound booths, simulated noise fields), as well as tools and associated analysis techniques to measure speech production in the environment (binaural microphones, accelerometers, noise dosimeters, electroglottography). REU students will engage in experiments testing the effects of language, voice and speech adjustments to communication demands (noise, reverberation, amplification, number and behavior of communication partner, communication content) in virtual and real rooms. Mentored undergraduate students a year: 6-8. Published papers with undergraduates = 4 in past 3 years. Conference presentations with undergraduates in past 3 years: 20.
