The CSLN theme of the REU program is associated with three inter-related questions that align with shared faculty mentor interests in language in noise:

1.	How do linguistic systems compensate for the unreliability of the signal in noisy conditions in acquisition and language processing?
 - Mentors: [Bongiovanni](people/bongiovanni), [Buccola](/people/buccola), [McAuley](/people/mcauley), [Munn](/people/munn), [Schmitt](/people/schmitt)
2. 	How does variability due to contact between different dialects or adaptation/accommodation to particular situations and speakers (typical and atypical) affect language acquisition by children and adult processing (both perception and production). Moreover, how do children and adults ‘fill in’ information that may be lost or disrupted?
 - Mentors: [Schmitt](/people/schmitt), [Venker](/people/venker), [Vallotton](/people/vallotton), [Walsh](/people/walsh)
3. How do different types of noise and variability affect acquisition and processing by both humans and machines?
 - Mentors: [Kordjamshidi](/people/kordjamshidi), [McAuley](/people/mcauley), [Hunter](/people/hunter)
